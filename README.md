Sky Engine v0.9.5
=================

Sky Engine is a basic 2D Games Engine for use with Android Development. It is still currently
under development, but a lot of the engine exists to be able to create basic games.

The Engine utilises the Android Canvas to draw shapes, sprites and text to the screen.

Sky Engine has been designed to have an almost XNA feel and approach, where after initially
creating the thread and surfaces with the main Activity itself; all game functions are
placed in a class that should implement StageInterface. This brings forth methods such as:

	* load
	* handleInput
	* update
	* draw
	
(Which may look familiar if you have used XNA before).



Documentation and Usage
-----------------------

This is all still fairly under construction at the moment.



Further Development
-------------------

	* 3D with OpenGL.
	* Multiplayer and Networking (as well as Bluetooth).
